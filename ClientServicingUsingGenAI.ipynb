Entiendo lo preocupante que puede ser esto, pero quiero que sepas que estoy aquí para ayudarte a solucionar este problema.\n\nSegún la información proporcionada, si el ruido solo ocurre al encender el coche y no mientras conduces, puede estar relacionado con el motor de arranque, la batería o el sistema de encendido. Para abordar esta preocupación, te recomiendo seguir los siguientes pasos:\n\n1. Revisa la batería: Asegúrate de que los terminales de la batería estén limpios y conectados de manera segura. Una batería débil o defectuosa a veces puede causar ruidos inusuales al encender el coche.\n\n2. Inspe"
